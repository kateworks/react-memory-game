# Memory game

## Description

A simple game to test and improve a playerâ€™s memory, implemented using React.


## Demo

https://kateworks.github.io/react-memory-game/


## How to play

There are 18 paired cards on the board 6x6 with different pictures on them.\
When a player pushes Start button, the timer starts.\
The player can open a card and then (in 5 seconds) -- another card.\
If the pictures on the cards are identical, they disappear from the board,
otherwise they are closed.\
The game ends (and the timer stops) when the board is empty.
