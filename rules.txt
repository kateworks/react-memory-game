A Match: A player makes a match if the two cards turned picture-side-up are identical.

When a match is made, the player takes both cards and places them in front of him or her.
That player then takes another turn, and continues taking turns until he or she misses.

A Miss: A player misses if the two cards turned over are not identical.
When a player misses, he or she turns the two cards picture-side-down again,
in the same place.

That player's turn ends-and all players try to remember which cards were turned over,
for future matches.


The game continues until all cards have been matched and removed from the playing area.

In turn, each player chooses two cards and turns them face up.
If they are of the same rank and color (e.g. six of hearts and six of diamonds,
queen of clubs and queen of spades, or both jokers, if used)
then that player wins the pair and plays again.
If they are not of the same rank and color,
they are turned face down again and play passes to the player on the left.
Rules can be changed here too:
it can be agreed before the game starts that matching pairs be any two cards of the same rank,
a color-match being unnecessary, or that the match must be both rank and card suit.

The game ends when the last pair has been picked up
